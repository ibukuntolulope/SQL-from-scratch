-- Window Functions

-- windows functions are really powerful and are somewhat like a group by - except they don't roll everything up into 1 row when grouping. 
-- windows functions allow us to look at a partition or a group, but they each keep their own unique rows in the output
-- we will also look at things like Row Numbers, rank, and dense rank

SELECT * 
FROM employee_demographics;

-- first let's look at group by
SELECT gender, ROUND(AVG(salary),1)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
GROUP BY gender
;

-- now let's try doing something similar with a window function

SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
AVG(salary) OVER()
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;

-- now we can add any columns and it works. We could get this exact same output with a subquery in the select statement, 
-- but window functions have a lot more functionality, let's take a look


-- if we use partition it's kind of like the group by except it doesn't roll up - it just partitions or breaks based on a column when doing the calculation

SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
AVG(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY gender)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal 
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;


-- now if we wanted to see what the salaries were for genders we could do that by using sum, but also we could use order by to get a rolling total

SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
SUM(salary) OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY employee_id) AS Rolling_Total
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;


-- Let's look at row_number rank and dense rank now


SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;

-- let's  try ordering by salary so we can see the order of highest paid employees by gender
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc)
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;

-- let's compare this to rank
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc) row_num,
Rank() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc) rank_1 
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;

-- notice rank repeats on tom ad jerry at 5, but then skips 6 to go to 7 -- this goes based off positional rank


-- let's compare this to dense rank
SELECT dem.employee_id, dem.first_name, gender, salary,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc) row_num,
Rank() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc) rank_1,
dense_rank() OVER(PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY salary desc) dense_rank_2 -- this is numerically ordered instead of positional like rank
FROM employee_demographics dem
JOIN employee_salary sal
	ON dem.employee_id = sal.employee_id
;
